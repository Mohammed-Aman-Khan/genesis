# Example: Task Deduplication
#
# This example demonstrates how Genesis deduplicates system-level tasks
# when multiple plugins require the same operations.
#
# Both Node.js and Python plugins will need to:
# 1. Update the package manager (apt/brew/choco)
# 2. Install system dependencies
#
# Without deduplication, "apt-get update" would run twice.
# With Genesis's task registry, it runs only once!

tools:
  - type: node
    version: "20"
    use_nvm: true

languages:
  - type: python
    version: "3.11"

# Expected execution flow:
#
# Phase 1: Plugin Execution
#   - Node plugin registers: apt-update, apt-install:curl
#   - Python plugin registers: apt-update, apt-install:python3.11
#
# Phase 2: Task Execution (deduplicated)
#   - apt-update (runs ONCE, not twice!)
#   - apt-install:curl
#   - apt-install:python3.11
#
# Result: Faster, more efficient installation!
